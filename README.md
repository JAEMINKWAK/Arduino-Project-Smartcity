  Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , this is my first project of my undergraduate year.
  <br> 
  It was created using three source codes: Gas Sensor, LED Switch, and Traffic Light.
  It was a project that implemented a part of a smart city with these.
  It was very clumsy because it was my first university project.
  We will come back with a better project through many studies in the future.
